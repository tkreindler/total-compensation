# Microsoft Total Compensation

This repo contains a website to easily plot out Total Compensation (TC) at Microsoft over time. It handles contingincies and amorticizes out stock awards and bonusses in a palatable format.

You can generate graphs that look something like this:

This can be very useful for people like Software Engineers with very complex and varying pay over time

# Potential Improvements

This is just a hobby project so I'm probably gonna leave it as is but there are a lot of potential avenues for improvement:

- Make the form UI not horrible looking
- Support multiple employers in sequence (possibly overlapping)
- Handle more edge cases and strange payment arrangements as people report them

If anyone wants to take a crack at any of these I'm happy to take pull requests.
